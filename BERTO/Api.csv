**Background**

From the time he started his career until he started making this album, Earl Simmons, known by many as DMX, had established himself as one of the most iconic rappers of all time. He broke out in 1998 with his debut album, *It’s Dark and Hell is Hot*, topping the Billboard 200 chart and has sold 4.8 million units.

X would quickly follow this success up later that year with *Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood*, an album which would see similar success. His hot streak would continue with his subsequent albums *…And Then There Was X*, *The Great Depression*, and *Grand Champ*, all of which topped the Billboard 200. This would make him the first artist to top the chart with his first five projects.

Like many careers tend to do, X’s started to slow down with the release of *Year of the Dog… Again*. The album debuted at #2 behind *NOW That’s What I Call Music! 22* and sold 126,000 units. While these numbers are still very high, it did not match the numbers his albums have historically put up. The release of 2012’s *Undisputed* saw an even deeper dip as the album only charted #19 and sold 17,000 units in the first week.

In the years following this, X was hit with a tax fraud conviction. While he was free for a little bit prior to sentencing, in January of 2018, he was sent back following a relapse. This would eventually lead to a year in prison, but when he got out, X was feeling stronger than ever.

He embarked on a tour soon after his stay in prison celebrating the 20th anniversary of his debut album and would sign a new 2-album deal with Def Jam, which would include a holiday album and what would become *Exodus*.

He was enthusiastic and ready to share the album with the world. He was excited about songs with Pop Smoke and Griselda, among others, and it seemed like he was ready to make his comeback. Unfortunately, in early April of 2021, tragedy struck.

On April 2, X was rushed to a hospital in critical condition after a cocaine-induced heart attack. After a week of tests and no improvements, Earl Simmons was pronounced dead at 50 on April 9, 2021.

In addition to one of the greatest legacies in hip-hop, X left behind a completed album ready for release. Swizz Beatz, who was working closely with X the last years of his life, made sure that his vision remained nearly completely intact and heard as he took it upon himself to promote this album and give it a proper release.

LONG LIVE DMX

&nbsp;

**Review**

The album opens with “That’s My Dog” with THE LOX & Swizz Beatz. The album opening with this hard-hitting posse cut sets the tone right away. As THE LOX are some of X’s closest collaborators, it makes sense that they would be the first three to rap on the album, even before the lead artist. After the three come hard over a Swizz beat and hook, X comes in with high energy and confidence to show that he still has his skill at 50 years old. This sets an exciting tone for what’s to come.

“Bath Salts” is a song with origins that date back to 2009. X repurposed his verse from “Spit That Shit.” A version of this song was also created for Nas’s 2012 album *Life is Good*, although it didn’t make the cut. In 2017, a version of the song, featuring JAY-Z, Nas, and Jadakiss, was premiered by Swizz in a beat battle. It was intended for his 2018 album *POISON*, but the song was also cut from that. The song continued to be reworked, with Nas writing a new verse for this album, Jadakiss being cut, and the removal of the hook, to eventually become the song that is on this album. This song gives you three of New York’s finest just going in on a hard beat with incredible bars by artists at least 2 decades into their careers. Ironically, as this is the song with the oldest vocals on it, this is the track that is currently up for Rap Song of the Year at the Grammys.

“Dogs Out” marks the first collaboration of X and Lil Wayne and as one can expect, it is a bar heavy banger complete with a simple, yet catchy hook by Swizz Beatz. This continues Weezy’s incredible feature run of 2021 while showing X can match up with one of the most clever lyricists of our time. They have always respected each other and it is a celebration that they were able to link up before X’s untimely passing.

“Money Money Money” is the only song changed after X’s passing. The song originally featured a verse by the late Pop Smoke, which was actually originally recorded over this beat. However, Smoke’s team decided that verse would sound better on “Demeanor,” so this unfortunately did not formulate. Instead, Swizz got Moneybagg Yo to spit a verse here. Despite its origins, Moneybagg manages to come through with a well made verse, which features a great flow and impressive bars that appropriately match up with the other heavyweights on this tracklist. X also comes hard in this verse. He comes through with great bars and his energy and delivery are major contributors as to what makes the song great.

With “Hold Me Down,” the record takes a break from the high-energy spitting that’s been going on throughout the album for an introspective cut. Alicia Keys comes through with a simple, yet beautiful chorus as X raps meaningful bars showing his strength over yet another great beat from Swizz.

Similar to “Bath Salts,” “Skyscrapers” is an older *POISON* throwaway repurposed for this album. With a beat from Swizz and vocals from Bono dating back to 2012, the song originally featured the former rapping two verses and another verse from Kanye West, with X recording his verses in 2020 for his album. Despite the 9-year-old vocals from Bono, he floats on the hook and bridge and sounds far from dated on the song. X recreates this song as an uplifting anthem about strength and faith that makes for a beautiful song.

What follows is a skit called “Stick Up,” featuring Cross and Infrared, who have previously collaborated with X, as well as the late Ice Pick, known as the A&R who produced the skits for Ruff Ryders albums. This brief interlude samples the classic “Party Up (Up in Here)” as the three rob a bank. It’s a fun throwback to the classic and beloved skits that appeared on albums of X’s era.

“Hood Blues” was released as the album’s lead single three days before the album. The song features Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine of the Griselda collective. What results is an incredible bar-heavy posse cut which gives each artist their spotlight. Westside opens the song with his iconic style and Benny follows with a hard verse. Conway comes in smoothly after the Butcher, continuing his incredible feature run. X came in last and showed how he still had it at 50 years old. He meshes well with the Griselda style and it overall creates for an incredible lead single.

“Take Control,” primarily produced by Denaun, is the song that came of X’s Verzuz battle with Snoop Dogg. Sampling Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” the two dogs take turn rapping seductive bars about pleasing their ladies. The song is reminiscent of the classic sensual rap songs of their era and despite it’s older style, it once again proves X’s, and even to an extent Snoop’s, longevity and skill failing to sound dated.

“Walking in the Rain” starts with a prayer from Exodus Simmons, X’s youngest child. It then cuts to the song with X singing the simple hook. X then raps an introspective verse reflecting on his past and faith. After this, Denaun, the song’s producer known for his collaborations with Eminem and as a member of D12, sings a beautiful bridge showing that while he is not always respected as he should be, he is always loyal. From here, his singing is infused with X’s hook. Nas then comes in with his second feature on the album, which ends up being one of his finest verses in years. He too reflects on his past and how he’s done a lot right. Had he changed some of his actions, he would not have been in the comfortable position he is in today. After another round of the hook, Exodus comes in once more singing its lyrics, closing out this beautiful song.

The next track is a skit that serves as the title track. Exodus comes in once again cheering on his father. It’s a wholesome, yet bittersweet, little clip that shows the environment surrounding X as he was creating the album.

The final song, “Letter to My Son (Call Your Father),” is another personal song. This track sees X speaking directly to his oldest son, Xavier Simmons. His verse, specifically the line about his drug use, almost feels like a goodbye letter not just to his son, but to his fans as well. Usher comes in with a beautiful hook reminding the listener to “call your father.” In between the two hooks he sings, Brian King Joseph gets the spotlight, which primarily consists of a beautiful violin performance, with him sneaking in two lines regretting not being there for “father,” which could be him talking to a father figure and/or God.

Closing out the album is the traditional “Prayer” track, which is the only track without a Swizz Beatz production credit of any sort. Rather, the track is produced by Kanye West, which has a relatively quiet instrumental. This prayer comes from West’s Sunday Service concert at Coachella on Easter. It seems fitting that the final track from possibly X’s final album is a prayer, a tradition he has stuck onto from the beginning even if the original intention may not have been a goodbye.

Overall, *Exodus* serves as the perfect swan song for DMX’s legendary career. Tapping a loaded list of features both from this generation and legends he came up with, the album’s diversity of hard, fun, and personal tracks gives a reminder of why X is so beloved as a rapper.

**Talking Points**

* How does this album compare to other posthumous releases, especially in recent years?
* Is the feature-heavy approach one that works well for an album like this? (Comeback/legacy albums, etc.)
* Would the album have improved if more people besides Swizz Beatz contributed to the production?
* If X’s estate were to make one last album as a more proper “goodbye” (assuming this is not specifically meant as one), how would you want that approached?",1641578895.0,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rydpsh/album_of_the_year_20_dmx_exodus/

8,ALBUM,"Happy 2022 /r/hiphopheads! Hope you all enjoyed your holidays and are ready to get back into it with our third official rate. 

We're kicking off the new year with a best of losers rate, to see which of the four albums we have here can reach the closest to the highs of The Heist. Whether you had wanted Kendrick to [win the first HHH rate](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2014/01/macklemore-kendrick-text.jpg) or maybe you just hate the [Grammy's in general](https://external-preview.redd.it/0W7oCo_jbkkLEHj-Vaov1lzrj8WISHEwF1VYynK6Z94.png?auto=webp&s=9ae1dd2b5adbe74a2c21af94f2f2a9d7dae12494), I hope to see you all participate as we revisit some well-loved, critically acclaimed albums from 2012-2013 and *Magna Carta*.

**If you’re new to rates, welcome!** A rate is essentially an event where we pit a few albums with a common theme against each other (try to guess this one’s). Everyone listens to them, scores every song out of 10, and sends those numbers to myself. In about a month, I’ll tally everyone’s scores and host a reveal where we’ll see how each song stacks against each other, from the lowest to the highest averaged scores. Rate reveals are a fun time all around, we joke, we roast, but we also talk pretty passionately about the music we're into. Check out the past two [reveal](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/qjt11y/rate_reveal_album_of_the_decade_rate_day_3_we_gon/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/r9lx2q/rate_reveal_90s_east_coast_debut_albums_rate_day/) for a feel. And if you have any more questions, the Rate 101 tab on this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AOkltnMZHDkiTA4fZ2Mg_Oo909kK7SiZFvIYsdXSeQs) is a great resource, although feel free to ask in the thread as well.

Now let’s get into the albums we’ll be rating over the next few weeks.

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6PBZN8cbwkqm1ERj2BGXJ1?si=HpL-mHtHTimFt529rpxvhQ) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-kid-m-a-a-d-city/1471277623) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/98714351) | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lS9HkMve0ec9D9wyWDVvRRKlNEl7E55h4)

For his second studio album and major label debut, Kendrick Lamar wanted to a sound that was different from his prior project, *Section.80*. So he looked back to roots of growing up in Compton. What led was an album that not only influenced by his hometown sonically, but also thematically. *good kid, m.A.A.d city* was billed as an autobiographical short film; just a glance at the album cover will tell you so, note the censorship of everyone's eyes except a young Kendrick. Lyrically it's a dense and at times a dark narrative, following the rapper through his adolescence in his city, as he deals with issues of lust, family, and gang violence. It's an album that manages to combine the intense, unfiltered storytelling in songs like ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"" with the more atmospheric, catchier tracks like ""Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"" into one cohesive, concept album. *GKMC* has been universally applauded since its release, it's been taught academically, and dubbed a classic; many fans, including myself, will call it their favorite Kendrick album still. 

[**Jay-Z - Magna Carta... Holy Grail**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Magna_Carta_Holy_Grail_cover.png)
> *You in the presence of a king, scratch that, you in the presence of a god*

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0OTjYdGtP7AbwOwbYsGhyi?si=7ve5ofoXT1Stvrm3VNTWCw) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/magna-carta-holy-grail/1440925178) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/21164134) | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lFsYTDKcgnuHuoX4JgbOwo-r1JYbeEtMY)

With the longest time between his last solo project and the one being rated, Jay-Z had a lot of expectations to meet with his twelfth studio album. And did he meet them? Well commercially, *Magna Carta... Holy Grail* was a roaring success. A release deal with Samsung allowed their users to receive the album for free; it also smashed expected debut numbers and broke Spotify streaming records at the time. All fitting for an album full of Jay's braggadocious lyricism over Timbaland's luxurious production. But the album doesn't fill its runtime with just mentions of fame and fortune. There's quite a lot of mention of the significance of family, especially fatherhood since Jay's first daughter was born quite recently. More so than the other albums included in the rate, *Magna Carta* features an all-star list of guest spots— artists like Justin Timberlake and Frank Ocean shine on tracks ""Holy Grail"" and ""Oceans"" respectively. Despite all this, the album left a lot to be desired from both critics and fans, so we'll see if time has changed this perspective. 

[**Drake - Nothing Was The Same**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Drake_-_Nothing_Was_the_Same_cover.png)
> *Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?*

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1XslIirSxfAhhxRdn4Li9t?si=jvX5S8V-STSJ3CH--HrS_w) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/nothing-was-the-same/1440820956) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/22563744) | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kRINftXw_QTiPPiJEAwgjZXEUJWn8_nJg)

While *Nothing Was The Same* couldn't win a Grammy for Best Rap Album as its predecessor *Take Care* did, the third studio album by Drake did solidify his imperial status in not just the hip-hop sphere, but beyond. Met with critical praise and remarked by fans as one of his most consistent works, this album is classic confessional Drake and all his inner musings on heartache, family, and the complications of fame. But don't box this as just a rap album. The title is an allusion to his musical evolution, moving away from solely rapping to incorporating R&B and synthpop such as on songs like ""From Time"" and ""Hold On, We're Going Home"". The whole project feels sincere, nostalgic, and essential; there's definitely a *NWTS* track for every listener out there.

[**Kanye West - Yeezus**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Yeezus_album_cover.png)
> *Yeezy season approachin', fuck whatever y'all been hearin'*

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7D2NdGvBHIavgLhmcwhluK?si=1svN3ytxRKCQTnuKfstfJw) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/yeezus/1440873068) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/20753857) | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m6VFZd8KNhbFoHGRhtzFakGNVSkMMGvbU)

What do you create after you've released your magnum opus? If you're Kanye West, well then... *Yeezus*. West's sixth solo studio album was born under a vision of creating something more freeform and minimalist, no doubt a reaction to his grandiose attempts at perfection with *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* and the creative restraints he was facing in his fashion endeavors. The result is a project that melds the aesthetics and sounds of his hometown of Chicago with his current lodging in Paris, touching on genres like drill, acid-house, and industrial music. It's abrasive yet sparse, but not too unfamiliar. With tracks like ""Blood on the Leaves"" or ""On Sight"", we see it's the same Kanye just dialed up, continuing his audacious sample work, but with unmatched levels of megalomania and lewd punchlines really only he can get away with. While *Yeezus* had near universal critical acclaim on release, between its unconventional release strategy and drastic departure from sound, it's still polarizing to the general public so it'll be interesting to see its performance here.

# Rules
***READ ALL OF THESE BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR SCORES***


1. Listen to every song from the standard versions of all four of these albums and assign a score to them between 1 and 10. If you’re feeling specific, decimals are okay to **one** place. Do not use any more than that since they’ll break the program used to generate results. So a **6.5 is okay**, but a **8.25 is not**. 

2. You have to listen and score each song on the ballot! If you miss a score, it’ll again break the program and your ballot will not be counted, but I will most likely reach out to you if this is the case.

3. Your scores are not a secret, feel free to discuss them wherever you feel like, whether that’s in the thread or in Daily Discussions. I’ve seen people comment to try to rally people behind their 11s, which I should also explain… 

4. You may give ONE song an 11 and ONE song a 0. Note one 11 and/or 0 **in TOTAL**, not for each album. Please reserve these for your most favorite and least favorite tracks, excessive sabotage ruins rate results and generally makes things less fun.

5. You can change you scores at any time— feel free to PM me at any point after submission and before the deadline and I’ll update those for you.

6. As mentioned, the program used to calculate results uses a specific format, so everything needs to written a specific way. Please use the submission link below to send your scores (there’s also a pastebin copy if needed), it’s already formatted for you. If you need to work on the ballot over multiple days, you can copy it and save it on a notepad app, but please just make sure to keep the formatting intact, it’ll make it easy for both you and me.

7. You are encouraged to leave comments on as as many songs as you like. If you would like to include comments with your scores, just make sure they are formatted the proper way.

This is correct:

> I Am A God: 10 I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song

These are incorrect:

> I Am A God: 10: I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song

> I Am A God:10 I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song

> I Am A God: I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song 10

> I Am A God - 10 I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song

> I Am A God - 10 - I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song

> I Am A God: 10 (I can't wait for this to be the least controversial song)


You can also leave comments on complete albums by adding a colon after the album name and then your comment (without a score), like so:

> Nothing Was The Same: and not in a good way

That's all from me! I can't wait to get your ballots, which you should

99,ALBUM,"Mos Def dropped 15 years ago what is widely regarded as his worst album. The lack of consistent quality on this album is really apparent and best explained as an uninspired project to end his deal with Geffen Records. The albums most obvious weak points are the off-the-shelf 2002 Funk Flex mixtape beats. That mixtape feeling is also carried with his freestyles over other rappers beats (Juvenile’s Noila Clap and GA’s Liquid Swords). 

On the flipside, it got a few gems, that make digging into the album worthwile. [U R the One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzPvjIyeX-Y) is a great love song.
Tracks like [Perfect Timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmU6SZwiAAk) and [Murder of a Teenage Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVOHMHcde8Q) got a unique atmosphere, the latter over a haunting Neptunes beat.

**Background by** /u/Kitchen_Ur_Lies

The culturally ubiquitous Kanye West, now [legally just “Ye”](https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-west-legally-changes-name-to-ye/), seemed to be working on everything besides music after releasing his latest solo effort, ‘Jesus Is King.’ A post-Jesus spin-cycle rendition of his cancelled album ‘Yandhi’, it gave listeners what was to be the first of his [exclusively non-secular gospel releases “from here on out.”](https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/29/kanye-west-says-he-will-no-longer-make-secular-music) After the uniquely mixed reception to a *West* effort, Kanye embarked on many ventures outside of music, including [helming a creative director role at Gap](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/business/kanye-west-yeezy-gap.html) and casually [running for president of the United States.](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1279575273365594112) As Kanye’s Gap and very successful [Yeezy](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bdd/d9c/1c5fe3aaee375d85f903377ffcae886444-9-kanye-west-forbes.rsquare.w1200.jpg) ventures seemed to make him [a billionaire by April 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2020/04/24/kanye-west-is-now-officially-a-billionaireand-he-really-wants-the-world-to-know/?sh=415b1b0a7b9e), music appeared to be an afterthought for the next iteration of his artistic catalogue.

During an interview with Michèle Lamy in May 2020, cinematographer Arthur Jafa, whose work includes Jay-Z’s [4:44 music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSkA61esq_c&ab_channel=JayZVEVO), announced he was [collaborating with West on a single off his previously unannounced record, *God’s Country.*](https://twitter.com/TeamKanyeDaily/status/1263626806525124612) This was our first tease at a new West album since [announcing Jesus is King II with Dr. Dre]( https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1196524372044861440) just one month after the former’s release. Stems from these sessions have made their way to the public, including on the aforementioned single and video Jafa worked on, [Wash Us In The Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0U2QUGKbSE&ab_channel=KanyeWest). A collaboration between Kanye, Travis Scott, Ronny J, and mixing by Dre, the industrial underpinnings of the track still met the laundry cycle of Jesus himself with censored lyrics and heavily reinforcing his reinvigorated faith. Excitement in the project was replenished by fans of the old Kanye just two weeks later, as he dropped a [teaser to a track called DONDA](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/0d4ea1_6cfea89a5414443ab05ddc1b5ab3f99b/720p/mp4/file.mp4), in memory of his late mother on what would have been her 71st birthday. The snippet begins with Donda West reciting lyrics to KRS-One’s *Sound of the Police*, with Kanye rapping about police brutality and racism over a soulful beat reminiscent of his earlier production techniques. The anticipation seemed to climax as Kanye quickly tweeted and deleted a [20-track album now called DONDA to be released on July 24,](https://twitter.com/KanyePodcast/status/1284618737824473088) which included track names from the Yandhi era. In typical Ye fashion, this was changed 2 days later to [a shortened 12 track album and seemingly focused on a gospel tone.](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1285433509142650881) July 24th came and went with not a peep from Kanye, until July 26th when he [posted the official artwork at the time for DONDA](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1287151490348412928), personally one of my favorite covers he’s ever had made. Not much was said about the album for two months while fully submerging into his presidential candidacy, until late September when he gave us the poorly named snippet for his recent tweets, [*Believe What I Say.*](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1309853179081830400) As the 2020 election grew closer, Kanye West released the official theme song for his campaign called *Nah Nah Nah*, complete with verses by DaBaby and 2 Chainz. When he announced he’d be running for president in 2020 [before *Pablo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFRR_M8mNkI&ab_channel=AJ%2B), the former sentence didn’t seem like it’d become reality. After his concession, it appeared DONDA was completely shelved as no new developments came towards the turn of the year, soon to be followed by family turmoil resonating with his name online at the start of 2021, as news broke that Kim Kardashian filed from divorce from Kanye. While some fans at the time turned this into hope for new music, [CyHi the Prynce ended up confirming this by early March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX4UnrW57Hw&ab_channel=djvlad) that Kanye had indeed gone back to working on DONDA. Months later, this turned into concrete evidence as posted by Consequence on Instgram video of [Tyler, The Creator and a masked Kanye working on music with a tracklist in the background.](https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.63258/title.kanye-west-tyler-the-creator-captured-working-on-possible-donda-album#). A day later, in the most respectful manner, full confirmation that DONDA exists came from Justin LaBoy after a listening session in Las Vegas with [“production light years ahead of it’s time, and the bars sound like he’s broke & hungry trying to get signed again.”](https://twitter.com/JustinLaboy/status/1416892827594854400) And if that wasn’t direct confirmation that something was to come soon, [Pusha T posted on his Instagram the day after that a listening event was coming to Atlanta Thursday July 22nd.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRhHSoWnHtH/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=c6ccb7f8-fa57-4db0-8f6c-51954ed32a11) The hype train was fully set in motion by a [Beats commercial premiered during game 6 of the NBA finals, confirming a DONDA release date of July 23rd, lining up for just after the listening party.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9lFaCkFN7I&ab_channel=BeatsbyDre) 

Donning [a red suit and army face mask](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc71b1e0b05745e9e764bd7d40cb5ee028e681d2/0_199_4682_2809/master/4682.jpg?width=1020&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=4c3e5c8aff0d90ba7f9de2f14631664b), Kanye sold out Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz stadium to premiere rough versions of 15 tracks that would make the album. The two hour delay for the entire event didn’t help, but when Ye finally emerged, he came to the center to [drop to his knees in prayer-like form, under a spotlight.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2666e7efb783ffcaee06c3c463bfda3ef9c3d195/0_3_4710_2826/master/4710.jpg?width=860&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=b37778d3f23fefc7caa215ae5cb4d861) This performance was not his most involved, as Ye never carried a microphone nor addressed the crowd, only playing formless stems of what was assumed to be a completed project to drop that same night. He repeatedly dropped to his knees, seemingly to look up to God for answers at questions he never conveyed directly, only briefly through some of the more somber songs such as Never Abandon Your Family. The most notable positive reactions came from Hurricane and Praise God, ending with the long awaited reunion of Kanye and Jay-Z on wax, with Jail.

Of course, the album never dropped that night. Instead, Kanye lived out the [Phantom of the Opera](https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTgyNjY3NzEwMDI1NDQyNzIz/kanye-west.jpg), living out of Mercedes-Benz stadium, affirming his ties to the city of Atlanta which is his actual birthplace, not Chicago. [Another Beats commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G75u6r2av4s&ab_channel=BeatsbyDre), and another album listening event/release date pairing were set for the evening of August 5th. The flare was kicked up a notch for the second showing, with most participants of the show and Kanye himself [wearing DONDA fitted vests that were seen in clips of his stay the 2 weeks between listening parties](https://media.gq.com/photos/610d6337539f373b4ca1bd8d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/KW%2520DONDA%2520LISTENING%2520EVENT_GUNNER%2520STAHL%25207.jpg). [Kanye loves his bed and his mama](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E8Ev1z6XEAQ5K_5.jpg), and they together took center stage to start the show. This second showing was lauded for having upgraded the sonic quality of the music, with clear bass and smooth high frequencies resonating through the stadium and the crowd. This listening party seemed to be a medley of high points throughout his career, blending notes and sequences from *808s and Heartbreaks*, *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*, *The Life of Pablo*, and elements of *Jesus is King*. The breadth of range in the tracks and standout performances from new collaborators such as Fivio Foreign, Roddy Ricch, and Griselda displayed the growth from the first listening session. With an overall gospel feel, yet hip hop in spirit, Kanye ended the show by seemingly [floating to the heavens to the tune of No Child Left Behind.]( https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kanye_UNDERWOOD_54-donda.jpg) Overall a great show, but still no album after.

As speculative album release dates were tweeted and posted and changed by streaming services, the only certainty was that Kanye was now going to bring the spectacle back to Chicago, and this time putting even more effort into the stage and show aesthetics. Kanye rebuilt his [childhood home, which has now become a tourist attraction in Chicago, and had several special guests stand and sit upon his porch.](https://media.gq.com/photos/612966278026fa2303b2f629/master/w_4000,h_3000,c_limit/1234897872) He derived the most scrutiny from the choice of guests, including DaBaby who recently brought upon himself backlash from the [LGBT community for an on stage outlash against gays](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/os6dvj/dababy_launches_into_homophobic_rant_about_hiv/), as well as Marilyn Manson who is [facing a series of rape and sexual assault allegations](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/he-horrifically-abused-me-for-years-evan-rachel-wood-and-other-women-make-allegations-of-abuse-against-marilyn-manson), *both* of whom were now associated with the album release and his childhood home. The erratic decisions coincided with some of his inclusions and removals from the songs heard before, such as seemingly kicking off Jay-Z, Kid cudi, The LOX, and Conway entirely off the project. The dark, brooding vibes continued the whole show with black masks and clothes covering most of the guests and those marching around his home. By the time Kanye got to Pure Souls and raps “this the new me, so get used to me,” his [childhood home engulfs in flames with him inside.](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_2.0,f_auto,q_auto,w_680/fl_lossy,pg_1/k3jjw27pksfwsojlu7hp/kanye-west-third-donda-live-performance-review-5?fimg-client) By the time Come To Life cues, [Kanye is fully on fire and begging not to die alone.](https://thatgrapejuice.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kanye-west-come-to-life-thatgrapejuice.png) As he slowly walks off the flames, No Child Left Behind’s church organs bellow the stadium as the spotlight shines on a white-hooded figure, Kim Kardashian in a Balenciaga wedding dress. [As she walks, she meets a maskless Kanye, who we hadn’t seen in months at this point](https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/08/27/07/kim.JPG?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75), re-enacting their wedding, in what seemingly was both a rebirth of his life and marriage.

At this stage, the album was set to release on September 3rd, 2021, coinciding with the release of Drake’s *Certified Lover Boy.* However, the album seemed to finally come *sooner* than the announced date, as it suddenly appeared on streaming services the Sunday morning after the last listening event, and the world could finally listen to what was meant to be the official release of DONDA, despite claims from Kanye that it was released without his permission.

**Review by** /u/Kitchen_Ur_Lies

Coming in at 1 hour and 48 minutes, 27 tracks, 30+ features, and 3 listening parties, the original album entered Kanye’s discography as his longest studio album to date. This was eclipsed on November 14th when the deluxe was released with an additional 5 tracks, and a new runtime of 2 hours and 11 minutes. Both the original and the deluxe contain several “part 2s” which are the same titled songs but with inclusions or swaps of featured guests, bloating the runtime and track list, yet with purpose. I viewed this as Kanye creating his most “customizable” album to date, allowing the *listener* to pick what the best version of a track is, and the lack of a proper cover art lends itself to that theory. Listeners are given the option to add their favorite version of a track to their playlists, whether it’s minute adjustments to production on a track like on Come to Life (Deluxe), or entire feature changes like on Jail pt 2. Most conventional deluxe albums will add the extra songs to the end of the project, but the deluxe also scrambles the track sequencing of the originally released album, even adding in “part 2s” to the middle of the project instead of at the end. The livestreaming of each listening party also made it very easy for avid fans [(real ones like me)](https://i.imgur.com/vclJHX8.png) to snip and keep previous versions of the songs to use towards their personal library. This is further supported by Kanye simultaneously releasing [an interactive stem player](https://www.stemplayer.com/) to control the vocals, drums, bass, and samples used in the album. A lot of high quality edits and blends [(plugging this BEAUTIFUL Heaven & Hell edit here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtEO1P22b5M&list=LL&index=1&ab_channel=uhhjulian) have come about as a result of this, possibly to the greatest extent of any Kanye release yet, and amazing ones can be found at /r/Yedits. Since I did most of my listening to the original sequencing of the album, I’ll write in that order, but insert words about “part 2s” with the original tracks.

DONDA opens with **Donda Chant**, a meditative chant spoken by Syleena Johnson, whose history working with Ye dates back to [*All Falls Down*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kyWDhB_QeI&ab_channel=KanyeWestVEVO). Repetitive mantras and prayers are common in several religions as a form of meditation, and using Donda’s name as the centerpiece to invoke this state lends to this album being dedicated to Donda. The ebbs and flows in how Donda is repeated resemble a drum or heartbeat, but unfounded claims that this was mimicking Donda’s final heartbeats have no substantial evidence.

**Jail** is the loud and abrasive opener to the themes of Donda, crisis and Christ. Backed by a blaring guitar riff reminiscent of “dad-rock,” Kanye uses the repetitive nature of the instrumentation and the hook to mirror the echoing thoughts he’s having at this point in life, complete with their grit. Having a highly publicized divorce from Kim Kardashian, Kanye is left in a frenzy as she breaks away and asks her to just take everything she wants. These lyrics are also an allegory for God to strip Kanye of possessions including wealth and family, similar to the Old Testament tale of Satan stripping those from Job. Themes of stripping and starting anew are explored many times throughout the project, with Kanye leaning on God for the rebirth portion of this cycle.

>Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?

>Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?

>Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?

>*God gon’ post my bail tonight*

Whatever metaphorical jail Kanye finds himself in, he leans on God to save him, including the fragile mental state a divorce would likely put him through. Having changed his phone number to avoid hearing Kim’s sides of things to preserve personal well-being, to looking at the bright side thinking “single life ain’t so bad,” Kanye reinforces that he’ll be alright as long as he’s with God. Kanye employs one of the most lauded rappers ever and his big brother, Jay-Z, to confirm his affirmations.

>God in my cells, that’s my celly

>Made in the image of God, that’s a selfie

>Pray five times a day, so many felonies

Jay paints the picture of the jail cell more vividly, and Kanye took this [a step further in the second listening party livestream by showing his living quarters.](https://chumley.barstoolsports.com/union/2021/08/05/E8Cm88oWUAQivSi.46b1d0d3.jpeg?crop=0.71%2C0.95%2Cx0.15%2Cy0.05%2Csafe) Continuing the themes of despoiling oneself, they’re both left to nothing more than their image others and God have given them. In Jay’s terms, that’s a selfie. Some of my favorite wordplay in the album comes with the simple line of “pray five times a day, so many felonies.” Jay is clearly referencing the Muslim practice of Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha throughout the day, but is exchanging his sins as felonies that must be made right before God. As Muslims fall to their knees in each prayer, Jay hopes to cleanse his “fell on knees.” He also takes this time to tease the return of The Throne, since Kanye has “stopped all of that red cap”, signaling another new beginning. **Jail pt 2** enlists Marilyn Manson and DaBaby, both fresh off controversy themselves. Marilyn Manson’s inclusions are reciting the hook along with Kanye, and in my opinion have no place on the album, as [his heinous allegations](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/marilyn-manson-abuse-allegations-1256888/) plus the fact Kanye did fine on the hook alone with the choir was ample already. As the track is echoing Kanye’s thoughts on starting anew, his original chorus already lent itself well to that. DaBaby took the golden opportunity to speak for himself as he felt the full backlash of unsavory homophobic comments at Rolling Loud this August. The money lost after being dropped from three upcoming festivals equated to food being taken off his daughters’ tables, and he reminds us of his harrowing past and upbringing that would lend to him being nothing more than a product of his environment, yet he still managed to rise out of it. As he took the fall for his remarks, he stands on his position and says if he’s “guilty, guess they gon’ have to take me” to jail tonight. [Soon after this verse came out, Kirk ended up meeting with HIV-Awareness organizations to learn about the impact HIV has on both the black and LGBT communities.](https://variety.com/2021/music/news/dababy-hiv-awareness-organizations-apologizes-1235052922/) Both versions of Jail end with a raucous drum medley akin to some of the drums on *Love Lockdown*, leading us out of the monotony of recurrent thoughts and sounds felt throughout the track. 

For **God Breathed**, Kanye continues themes of repetitive nature in calling on God to cleanse his actions and provide guidance for the future. The title likely references 2 Timothy 3:16, which states,

>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness

As the last track divested Kanye, he’s taken a new turn and admits he may not know everything, all he knows is that God breathed on this. By telling the listener that God’s doing more than he himself can put into words, he reminds us to look at what he has done long before there were sons and daughters and sun and water. He cues his divorce once more, saying that putting besides the lawyer fees and loyalties, God will solve it all for him. The entire time he recites these chants, the soundscape built around the track is reminiscent of [*I Am A God*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuQoQgL63Xo), with a thunderous bass backing harsh bellows after every other bar, mirroring the menacing drums in the former track. Vory acts as a conduit for Kanye’s renewed thinking

>Devil on my shoulders, I can’t let em breathe

>Brush ‘em off my sleeve, I’m filled with memories…

>Their hearts are filled with greed

>Okay, now they want the old me…

>I know that you’d be proud if you was here today

>But it’s okay ‘cause I’m okay

Reflecting on his past relationship with God on wax, such as telling God he’ll “be back in a minute” on [*Can’t Tell Me Nothing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E58qLXBfLrs&ab_channel=KanyeWestVEVO), to featuring him on the previously mentioned *I Am A God*, to how he reveres him once more. As people ask for the old Kanye, and a lot *did* ask for secular music after *Jesus Is King*, he recites how greedy that is considering he’s now doing what he feels is best for him. The last lines are certainly talking to the eponymous Donda, who Kanye’s well-documented grief from losing her has transformed him since late 2007. As of this track he’s now a billionaire with four kids he’s proud of, giving him the solace that he’s made her proud by now. He allows the track to literally breathe for 2 more minutes after these last lines are said, staying faithful to the song’s name.
 
**Off The Grid** explains Kanye’s actions for everything he’s done in his life so far. *Everything* had purpose, and is the perfect leadup to God Breathed, since he’s not doing everything just for his four kids, but for *their* grandkids, and when *they* have kids. Going off the grid means being divisive, separating yourself, and otherwise not being complacent. In the literal sense, Kanye moving to Wyoming in 2018, the least populous state in the United States is the contra to living in Los Angeles the past few years. In addition, people have either ostracized or praised his behavior throughout his career. Kanye finds himself to be heaven sent, and while he may not speak exactly what he meant, he doesn’t hide his intent. He’s done divisive actions ranging from calling out George Bush for his Katrina efforts or lack thereof, stopping an award winner from giving her thank you speech, calling out the fashion industry for blackballing him, or endorsing Trump and verbally saying “400 years of slavery sounds like a choice to me.” His intent was unmistakable with each action, and even after the backlash of each, he never faltered in changing the stance. And through this outlook, he was able to bring his life in a direction he couldn’t have reached without it. Someone else who tends to be on novel trends in music and fashion is Playboi Carti, whose contribution does bring light to an artistic direction made throughout the album; no cursing. [In a Drink Champs interview, he revealed this was because his eldest daughter North wanted no cussing on the album.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27NstO1qOJk&ab_channel=REVOLT) Many guest verses on this album including the Carti one detract a bit due to the decision, but it doesn’t seem like something that will be updated in the future even though an explicit version does exist. Carti’s verse is fun and a bit of an ode to his lifestyle, tatts, his new kid, and more fashion. The apex of this track (and first half of the album for that matter) is subtly introduced as the track’s heavy, brooding 808s are exchanged for a higher pitched 808 with fast kicking drum pattern evocative of Brooklyn drill. Keen listeners would notice the drill instrumental taking over, and are met with the voice of Fivio Foreign, who arguably gave his standout performance of his career, akin to something Kanye has done for other artists, such as Nicki Minaj on [*Monster*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS6HRKZQLFA&ab_channel=KanyeWest-Topic) and Rick Ross on [*Devil in a New Dress*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW5DjagYfok&ab_channel=KanyeWest-Topic) early in their careers. [Fresh off a 3 month stint in jail on gun charges](https://www.revolt.tv/article/2021-07-13/49303/fivio-foreign-reveals-hes-free-following-april-arrest/), Fivio entered [a cell once more, though this time with Kanye and a microphone.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E8BeHopUcAEojlx.jpg) And in there, they found fire. Carrying Kanye’s Christian themes further, Fivio describes how his sentence didn’t make him lose faith once, as he prayed and felt God carry both feet, and now he stands as a God-like figure. He decisively pronounces his mental fortitude after his jail stint and now feels marvelous, almost like they let the monster loose. Contrasting DaBaby’s claims of being a product of his environment, Fivio emphatically says he’s “what God produced.” Praying is central to Fivio’s MO just like Kanye as well as he knows his old friends pray they settle their differences, while he prays they lower his current friends’ sentences. The main draw of Fivio’s verse is how he decides to enunciate certain words or play around with ad libs, stating “and my car quicker” and delivering one of his signature SKRRRT ad libs. As he rises through the industry, having battled demons and rapping on [*Demons*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecopKVhf5io) with Drake, the word of advice he has for newcomers is 

>If you got a voice then you gotta project it

>If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it

>If you got a name, then you gotta protect it

>If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)

Protecting your name and your figure are central to him, as he’s one of the two main Woo rappers that blew up in 2019, the other being his deceased collaborator and friend, [Pop Smoke](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c71fa9f8d97406dfec4507d/1597192506264-R29P3IJ4CBMKJREUNE7E/unnamed.png?format=750w) who was killed in February 2020. The release of Fivio’s verse came out to rave reviews in early August 2021, exactly a year after [unfounded reports that Fivio himself was killed in Atlanta.](https://thesource.com/2020/08/09/fivio-foreign-involved-in-atlanta-club-shooting-over-the-weekend/) Even after that, and especially the rave reviews, the previously undisturbed instrumental after his verse now came with a new Kanye verse at LP3 and on the album. He delves further into how his actions affect the grid, including his viral moments, and how he won’t do an interview to explain himself after the criticism takes place. He gets into why [he wears a mask on his face](https://manofmany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kanye-West-White-Face-Mask-1200x900.png) to hide his next move, and his constant moving to get away from miserable people, something in his Drink Champs interview he revealed is because all he carries is a bag of his belongings and calls that “home.” Emphasizing his leverages in life are his God power, and the only beverages he drinks is Holy 
Water, this is perhaps the most effort in a Kanye rapping verse since the closer of TLOP, [*Saint Pablo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9rzz4pDFwA&ab_channel=KanyeWest-Topic). 

**Hurricane** has been one of the most fluid tracks on this project, dating back to its inception in [a Yandhi teaser from 2018](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1045415959551307776?lang=en) and several reworks since, including three distinctively different versions played at each listening party. The *Yandhi* leaks floating around have verses from Ant Clemons, Big Sean, Ty Dolla $ign, Young Thug, and 6ix9ine, but the two features on the final version didn’t come until years later. In a very erratic tweet storm around the time of DONDA’s original announcement, [Kanye announced Meek is getting between him and Kim, Kris Jenner is Kris Jon-Un, but most importantly that Lil Baby is his favorite rapper but can’t get him on a song.](https://www.rap-up.com/app/uploads/2020/07/kanye-west-kim-k-tweets-1.jpg) Thankfully this was a false alarm as [Baby just didn’t know](https://twitter.com/lilbaby4pf/status/1286115206440124417), and so he was flown out to Cody, Wyoming to record his verse the next day. A year later, this verse surfaced at the first listening party along with a Kanye verse and hook on Hurricane, only for the week after that [The Weeknd revealing in a GQ interview that he’d love to work with Kanye again](https://www.gq.com/story/the-weeknd-september-cover-interview). [Calls were promptly made](https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670426557.jpg), and The Weeknd’s lyric tenor is risen to belt high resonant notes within the fifth octave for the same picturesque hook we’ve heard many renditions of. The beauty in this version is how the choir compliments The Weeknd’s voice, appearing intermittently with harsh distortion on the production, simulating the wash of a wave, like in a hurricane. [Surfing on that wave comes Lil Baby](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E68uv5XWEAI0IvK.jpg), delivering some humble bars showing how his hunger drove him to success. With each hook, The Weeknd delivers exceedingly piercing vocals to punctuate the point that God is looking over all of us as the rain falls. Kanye takes over the weather report, recounting God making it rain, while the devil makes it hail, and above all how he prevailed. The gem of this track is the progression of the simple trap drums we get in the intro, to the organs throughout the track melding trap with the gospel tone of the album. The closed hat panning across the stereo range mimics debris being kicked around in a hurricane, and they vanish as a break in the storm happens, [with the best way I can describe this as Hurricane seems to be the inspiration for this cover art.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdzhchwVoAECGkb?format=jpg&name=large)

In the released track sequencing, **Praise God** is the first track to include vocal excerpts from Donda herself. In late October 2007, [Dr. West gave her last public speech as an honored guest at a poetry conference hosted by her alma mater, Chicago State University.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GImj5hKD4Jk&ab_channel=deadset) In this, she talks about the writing process of her book on raising Kanye, and how social consciousness, racial injustice, and black youth empowerment influenced her relationship with him. The first excerpt appearing on Praise God is her reciting a poem from Gwendolyn Brooks, which effectively is about perseverance through hardship in the context of the next generation of blacks, but it could also be interpreted as Kanye pushing through the grief of losing his mother among other tribulations that have come now. The transition from Donda’s speech to Travis and Kanye shaking off the devil over thunderous bass claps is such a moment on the album, that it’s become viral on Tiktok since release and has catapulted this song to the best performing on the album to date. The eerie hums from Travis, evocative of his transitory hums on [*90210*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuNBLjJzRoo&ab_channel=TravisScottVEVO), mark the transition all three are taking from forgotten faith or “spiritual death”, to becoming spiritually alive and reborn by praising God, using [direct imagery from the Valley of Dry Bones in the Old Testament.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/127.Ezekiel%E2%80%99s_Vision_of_the_Valley_of_Dry_Bones.jpg) This sets the stage for Baby Keem to start his [Tame Impala shoutout habit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFccM2NwhGc&ab_channel=EasternSteak) and even delivering a clever bar about how most believers of God only use him like renter’s insurance, only in their time of need, and not revering Him when things are going well.

**Jonah** is dedicated in namesake to [Jonah Ware, a 19-year-old musician and advocate against gun violence who was killed in Louisville, KY.](https://www.wave3.com/2020/08/08/local-recording-artist-identified-victim-shot-killed-chickasaw-neighborhood/) Knowing this context, the melancholic instrumental and hook that drives the track is reserved for a sulking mood.

>Like who’s here when I need a shoulder to lean on?

>I hope you’re here when I need the demons to be gone

>And it’s not fair that I had to fight ‘em all on my own

Vory reflects on the feelings of loneliness and solitude as he’s left to fight his mental despair or “demons” on his own without his significant other. This could be applied to Kanye’s current state, both in losing his mother and having to figure his tribulations on his own, or his current divorce and the betrayal that sets in his mind. Durk’s contribution signifies this as a tribute to victims of gun violence and their loved ones, as Durk himself lost one of his signed artists and close associates [King Von in November 2020](https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lil-Durk-King-Von-1.jpg), closely followed by [his own blood brother Dontay Banks Jr. in June 2021.](https://www.rap-up.com/app/uploads/2021/06/lil-durk-dthang-gucci.jpg) While Kanye and Jay as brothers were able to keep their bond until they both became billionaires, Durk’s brothers were stopped at just millionaires. Kanye also tries to dead the “smoke an opp pack” slang that’s proliferated the internet and gang cultures in recent years for its blatant disrespect of the dead.

**Ok Ok** is honestly the most ok ok song on the project, as its about backstabbing and betrayal in the music industry from the perspectives of Kanye, Lil Yachty, Rooga, and Fivio Foreign through his aggressive ad libs. Kanye is taking pretty direct jabs at Drake, with probably his most Drake sounding melodies in the project for both his verse and the hook. Lil Yachty’s portion has hums that seem to build up to something but fizzle out by the end of his verse. Rooga hops on to claim they closed the door on him, [after just reminding us they done let the GDs in the door.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAkl9fPchvI&ab_channel=JHERooga) **Ok Ok pt 2** swaps Yachty for Shenseea, who has the most interesting contribution by playing with her Patois tongue on the beat more playfully than everyone else. 

An ode to their passion for fashion, Kanye and Playboi Carti reunite to give a tribute to **Junya** Watanbe, a Japanese designer closely associated with Comme des Garçons. The most bass distorting 808s are found on this track to compliment the braggadocious themes Carti and Kanye rap on. Kanye can’t seem to find any misses in his discography, while Carti recounts having hits the past 5 summers. The prominent organ makes a reappearance here and gives the track a fun flair in addition to the clap, but this also makes the reappearance of Drake shots which watered down both their projects. He warns Drake to stay off his release, even though Kanye is the one that’s instigated for months he wants to dorp the same day as Drake. 

**Believe What I Say** is an ironic title coming from a guy who always delays the work to his fans, so it’s the perfect track to sample another amazing artist who also gives their fans the constant bait and switch for her shows, Lauryn Hill. He originally wanted to sample her back on The College Dropout for [All Falls Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axFIoWPVoL0&ab_channel=rn1432), but ended up going with Syleena Johnson to re-sing the vocal portions for sample clearance issues. This time he samples her biggest solo hit, [Doo Wop (That Thing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6QKqFPRZSA&ab_channel=laurynhillvevo)) with ease, and far more involved than last time. The bounce of the track gives an idea of how much fun Kanye had playing with it on an MPC. Playing on his speech, he recites that most people don’t agree with his method of delivering his message, that he now feels [he needs to get across and past his point](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1306209194249347072) to be satisfied. The beautiful melody pairs well with Kanye showing some improvement in his vocal performing during the hook.

**24** might be the most heartfelt track on the album, dedicated to the late and great [Kobe Bean Bryant](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/db9a166/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1658x2068+0+0/resize/840x1048!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F45%2F56d5fb5240759e08ca3b4403122c%2Fla-sp-kobe-drawing.JPG), who was tragically killed with his daughter and seven others in a helicopter crash January 26th, 2020. The shock was felt around the world and as tributes poured out, it did inspire art in some musical minds. He enlists his Sunday Service Choir to invoke the pain and enlightenment of the mourning victims. As they wallow over the same 24 hours we’re all given and how there’s never a right time to go, [Kobe’s memory is left to 24 candles](https://www.100candles.com/res/images/gallery/g17962.jpg) found in tributes across the world. Kanye has used God to talk to his mother throughout music since her passing, and the choir uses Him as a conduit once again, speaking to Kobe saying that he’s still alive because God’s never finished. Not allowing the grief to consume anymore, optimism shines and the choir chants that we’ll be ok as the organ resolves into the refrain. It’s also worth noting [this is one of the few tracks with a video on the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np2IqqJ5otg&ab_channel=KanyeWest), giving us perspective on where Kanye went after floating out of Mercedes-Benz stadium. As the song transitions from cries of salvation to personal content, Kanye wanders towards images of his late mother and finally reaches peace once he makes it to Heaven and sees everything will be alright.


At this point I need to break up the review into the comments due to reddit’s character limit per post, but I’ll give my final thoughts here. Overall, *Donda* is the most refreshing entry to Kanye’s legendary discography almost 20 years after its inception, and easily the best since *The Life Of Pablo*. Elements of his entire discography come into play, sampling different notes and flavors of tracks to produce a sonically diverse, yet thematically focused project. At a point in his career and life filled with his highest peaks of financial success, and familial woes and lows, *Donda* acts as a therapeutic channel for Kanye to grieve, mourn, and rejoice all at the same time. The listening parties added to the hype for me, with each version successively improving or altering my expectations of the final product, while also giving me and the internet creative freedom over the versions to listen to.

>All that smoke heaven sent (Scent)

>Everything I spoke, what I meant (Ah)

>Never disguise my intent, lines outside the event

>Brought my life out the trench

- “Off The Grid”

>God made it rain, the devil made it hail

>Dropped out of school, but I’m the one at Yale

>Made the best tracks and still went off the rail

- “Hurricane”

>You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares

>Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

>Been in the dark so long, don’t know if the light here

>But I’m just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear

- “Jesus Lord”

**Talking Points**

- Where does this rank in his discography?

- Did the wait substantiate the work, or were you left expecting more?

- Favorite verse on this project? There’s many standouts, and I still have trouble picking one based off replays versus sheer lyrical display.

- Does something as non cohesive as *Donda* function better in the streaming era where we can curate our own sequencing?

- [Do you want Donda 2?](https://bit.ly/3JK9VVl)

- CLB or Donda?",1641406499.0,949,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rwt70d/album_of_the_year_19_kanye_west_donda/

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

Q: Why is X artist higher than Y artist on the 200 chart, even though X artist sold less?

A: This is because of a discrepancy between Billboard's ranking and the ranking from the website that the sales data is scraped from

Q: Where do you get the sales data from?

A: https://hitsdailydouble.com/sales_plus_streaming

Q: What does ""err"" mean on the 200 chart?

A: If you are seeing ""err"", that means that the bot I use to gather chart data couldn't identify sales data for a particular album because of a difference in album naming between Billboard and HitsDailyDouble",1641395306.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rwp0ma/billboard_chart_discussion_week_of_january_08_2022/
180,ALBUM,"Lil' Boosie dropped his sophpmore album (the first with an added *Lil'*) 20 Years ago. After C-Loc, Yung Bleed and Max Minelli (among other members of Concentration Camp) laid the groundwork for the Baton Rouge rap scene in the late 90s, Boosie represents the city’s second generation (his debut was titled Youngest Of Da Camp). His debut had already gotten him a deal with Pimp C’s label Trill entertainment (who is featured on the stand out track [Head Busta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=918wSGNb7tg&list=PLpSoragYJBgz_F0JZz6zw3Nf65kinVXLj&index=7)) and he had the city behind him (as shown on the cover) to achieve even greater things. It’s remarkable to me how this album already got the signature Baton Rouge [Jiggin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acy_k-RlpQ8) sound on some tracks ([Bout That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_a9kODEMOM&list=PLpSoragYJBgz_F0JZz6zw3Nf65kinVXLj&index=9), [It's Going Down Pt. II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQtTWoYjlc&list=PLpSoragYJBgz_F0JZz6zw3Nf65kinVXLj&index=15) or [Bucked Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Pn3_nN3bE&list=PLpSoragYJBgz_F0JZz6zw3Nf65kinVXLj&index=5)) even though it wasn’t featured on his debut. 

Producers Tru dawg, Steve Beelow and Lil Q gave him an updated sound, but the album is still has a DIY feeling. Most tracks here are true to its title and overflow gangsta lyrics, but Wonder Why Your Child So Bad, World Wide Struggle and Consequences also show a lot of introspectivenes. That modern *bluesman* lyricism has only increased over his career and today he often has a 50/50 mix of both.",1641405750.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rwswfv/discussion_lil_boosie_for_my_thugz_20_years_later/

**How do certifications work?**

When a song has 150,000,000 streams in the US or 1,000,000 sales, an artist can purchase a certification (for around ~$300). You don't automatically get a plaque when you cross the threshold. The label or the artist needs to buy it. Often artists will buy certifications in bulk before they release new music.",1641319924.0,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rw0r79/riaa_certifications_october_november_2021/

**Background by** [/u/djreshiram](https://www.reddit.com/u/djreshiram/)

2021 was the perfect year to get familiar with TiaCorine. For starters, the Winston-Salem, NC artist dropped *The Saga of 34Corine*, technically a deluxe version of her 2020 project *Corine*. Tia also managed to play all 3 [Rolling Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQh27B4ZQ4I) festivals in the US, make a song for fast food chain [BoJangles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_ABCEEyxk), drop a 3 song EP exclusively on SoundCloud called [*Pussy*](https://soundcloud.com/tiacorine/sets/pussy), and most recently, she has a new song on [GTA Online](https://soundcloud.com/onthinice2/coochie) with Kenny Beats.

To say the least, if you haven’t heard of TiaCorine yet, wake the fuck up.

The NC artist initially went viral for her single “[Lotto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNGPeEJ6meM)” in 2019. The song saw success on TikTok going as far as a DaBaby [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNGPeEJ6meM). Both versions being featured on *The Saga of 34 Corine*. The album is an additional 8 songs to her previous release *Corine*. All songs, [but](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fTGh0imCRgP2FcsLLlj01?si=2e6de82d20574786) [two](https://open.spotify.com/track/11ZCA7JOHsox4JxKRV1oh0?si=9fe909e7d88b4687), return on *The Saga of 34Corine*.

So what does it sound like?

It has been described as [Animé Trap](https://flaunt.com/content/tiacorine-meet-tiacorine-anime-trap-chameleon).

It’s hard. It’s cute. It’s badass. It’s quirky. It’s random. By far one of the most interesting albums of the year, and one of my favorites of 2021. TiaCorine is no doubt the one to watch and I’m super enthusiastic to share my personal thoughts on the album!

**Review** by [/u/djreshiram](https://www.reddit.com/u/djreshiram/)

**Santa**

*The Saga of 34Corine* opens with a 3 bar loop before swirling you into the hard beating 808 world she’s crafted. Great ad-libs with autotune vocal work occupy the landscape with these glittering and shimmering synths. Tia comes in with a great melodic first verse before going back into the ad-lib hook. One of the only features on the album, Frais006, comes in and does a fantastic job matching Tia’s energy. He comes in with her flow, mirroring and bouncing off the beat with it. The outro is this beautiful autotune voice run that gets reversed along with the beat, as Mario slingshots you into the next track.

**You Knew**

The song doesn’t hesitate to slap you with bass and these reversing sounds that are chaotic and insane. Tia comes in with a great hook. A thunderous kick comes in as well, accompanying Tia’s soothing voice. Verse one sounds so clean on the production, perfectly intertwined with it. After another hook, Tia gives you 4 more bars before…

**On P’s**

…Samuel L. shoots you right into the next track.

If you haven’t noticed by now, these songs have been transitioning smoothly into one another. “On P’s” is a whimsical guitar ballad. But like everything in Tia’s world. There’s a thunderous 808, with trap hats and lyrics about killing opps. Her hook is great, but god damn, her flow on the verse is so nice. She’s so smooth on this track, it’s equally pretty as it is vicious.

It’s this juxtaposition she finds time and time again in new creative manners that make Tia so interesting. This song features a second verse, being one of the lengthiest tracks on the album, at three minutes and eleven seconds.

**Hotel Mink**

These bouncy keys hit you immediately before Tia shows off another cadence. Another thing she does well is catch different cadences, similar to contemporaries from Baby Keem to Rico Nasty to Zelooperzs, whoever you wanna compare it to, because everyone who’s cool is doing it.

The song features some hella sexual lyrics. This song sounds like a great one-night stand in some hotel room in a big city. LA, NY, Chicago, etc. Tia throws a good chunk of lyrics before Chris Tucker in Rush Hour…

**Tacos**

…yells at you into the next song. “Tacos” is a daunting beat. One thing Tia does well here is rap! Coming in hot with the Goodie Mobb reference, she rhymes her ass off in a catchy flow. And she keeps it going, riding the beat so well, keeping the food reference going with getting the cheese, fuck a nachos. She also has you beating it down like bongo and can get you clean like a snot nose. Hella bars bruh.

**34 Villain**

This song kicks off with an anime sample before being uplifted with a heavenly synth. Then the angelic Tia voice comes in with the appropriately overbearing bass. This track has you floating with more sex lyrics. It’s reminiscent of some Lil Wayne from his Autotune era, but there’s still a flow Tia hits that is unique to her own. The song ends with an action scene and piano playing the track off.

**Luigi**

Luigi is produced by Kenny Beats, who is also credited as a guest artist on the track. One of the best things about the project so far has been Tia’s beat selection. It’s not really like anyone else’s. The closest comparison is Carti and Uzi. All three have their own unique sound, as Tia has this cute yet heavy-hitting mystique about her beats. Truly one of a kind.

Kenny finds his pocket in her sound. That’s not without saying this track sounds the most commercial. That’s by no means a bad thing as Tia very much is a pop artist in my opinion. She’s versatile to say the least. Yes she can rap. Yes, she can croon, she can make hood slappers. Tia can even make rock songs. So of course she can do a pop rap track. Cue Luigi.

The track is hella bouncy, featuring a lot of the fun vocal production style we’ve seen Kenny do with other artists. Tia sounds amazing, spitting a catchy hook with great ad-libs. Both verses are great, but damn the second verse! Fantastic performance, especially the last part with the filtered vocals. A great first effort from Kenny and Tia, and more to come, as the two have the GTA song still to be officially released, as well as more unreleased tracks they’ve teased on social media.

**Pancakes**

This is my personal favorite track on the album, for the same reason I love “Tacos”. She raps! And has food references up the ass!!!! Maybe it’s because she’s always smoking.

First, this fucken beat, produced by Diego Ave and Bankroll Got It, is crazy. Let this be the flute beat to end flute beats. The 808 is amazing, especially when it goes into the higher registers. And again, the synths on this whole album, beautiful.

Back to Tia’s rapping. Fuck this shit is incredible. It’s 3 verses with just one-liners and flex bars up the ass. Some of the slickest shit is said in the second verse. She sets the verse up with “Bitch I can’t twerk with this glock up in my pants”. If that’s not the hardest shit. Amazing song.

**Lotto - Part 2**

So Lotto appears twice, first here as “Part 2”. It’s the version with DaBaby.

I’ll be honest I skip this cause I prefer the original, but the song is a banger, DaBaby drops an 8 and then it’s the fire verse Tia spits. I’ll talk more about the song later.

**Forever**

Forever is the first song from the original release that appears on *The Saga Of 34Corine*. A great throat clear kicks out the track as the swirling synths come in and out. Then the bass hits and Tia comes in bar after bar. This song is a great vibe catcher as you just get lost in her sweet cadence. Verse 2 is just as good as verse 1, maybe even harder with some slick bars. Just another fantastic record that ends with some DBZ…

**IKYK**

…then an evil laughter hits you, as well as some bedroom toy piano. Tia uses the autotune over more beefy 808s and rapid trap production. The beat features a wavy ghost synth before another solid verse is delivered from Tia. This is the shortest track on the album at 1:37.

**In My Room**

This song hits you with a bell-like synth melody, with a counter-melody from a buzzy, almost vocal-like synth and more fierce 808s, no heartbreak.

Tia lyrically is on her, I can’t save no hoe, type shit. It’s fire, kinda like everything she does. She skates with more Autotune hitting different flows over the beat keeping the ears interested. The hook’s melody is definitely a seller.

**Mine**

Another high profile producer track with Sonny Digital, Mine is another personal favorite. Her cadence and flow is so fucken smooth. Not to mention the beat is on some late night drive hotbox session. The grooviest bass on the album is featured with ethereal piano chords drowned in beautiful effects and filters. Tia hits another slick hook which repeats an appropriate 4 times, and is bridged together with a pre-chorus and 2 verses. Great fun bars throughout the track, as the song ends with a tempo change…

**Lotto**

…right into Lotto. Definitely the version I prefer because god damn, hands down one of the cutest, stickiest, and hardest hooks ever. A song that came out in December 2018, it holds up and sounds ahead of it’s time even still. The song only has a couple sections. It’s an intro, chorus, refrain, verse, chorus, refrain, then outro.

This is a clear example as to why I’d consider TiaCorine a pop artist. She follows the basic formulas of song structure to make short catchy tracks. She does a lot with a little and it’s a evident strength of hers. This song is up there with The Beatles “Hey Jude” and Michael Jackson’s “Billy Jean” as contenders for catchiest pop songs. Yes that’s an over-exaggeration, I don’t care, fight me.

**Avril Lavigne**

*The Saga Of 34Corine* ends with a pop-punk inspired banger, as it would. Structurally another pop record, this song does what a lot of pop punk-hip-hop crossover tracks fail to do, which is present itself respectfully. A lot of rap artists wanna try this style, and they just come off too vulnerable, to the point where it’s either embarrassing or laughable. Tia manages to be very poetic with her words here, giving herself space with a nice 6 syllable flow.

Another comparison I’d make to Tia is just a general comparison to 90s artists. More so the alternative rock scene of the 90s. It was really broad. Smashing Pumpkins didn’t sound like Sneaker Pimps which didn’t sound like Butthole Surfers which didn’t sound like The Prodigy. This song in particular made me see that comparison, and it’s because at the end of the day, Tia is a great lyricist, much like a lot of the artists of the 90s. It’s her lyrics that shine no matter if she’s rapping on trap beats or singing over guitars.

The song ends appropriately with a Sailor Moon snippet, thus concluding *The Saga Of 34Corine*.

**Talking Points**

Do you think TiaCorine has the potential to be big?

Is there anything else out there that sounds like *The Saga of 34Corine?* What other artists do you think sound like her?

Of all the styles she showcased, which would you say she’s best at? Any you disliked?

Would you consider TiaCorine more of a hip-hop artist or a pop artist?

Do you think TiaCorine and Kenny Beats have good chemistry?

You ask a lot of millennials and they’ll speak about their time in High School listening to a Cudi or Mac Miller religiously. Some would say Chance The Rapper.

I graduated High School 2019 and I know it sounds like revisionist history and whining about my era but I genuinely believe my time in high school, it was mostly about singles and there was less defining artists people had actual connections. When I hear of people with stories about 50 coming onto the scene and how that correlated with their time in high school so he became a representation of an important time in their life, I don’t know if the late 2010’s really had that. The closest I can think is Travis Scott but I don’t know how much of that was just Sicko Mode.",1641188799.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/ruudgj/what_rap_artist_do_you_think_defines_the_late/

For an example, my favorite rapper who isn’t considered “good” or super lyrical is Crunchy Black from Three 6 Mafia. Nothing he ever spits is spectacular, pretty much subpar lyrically but something about his vocal melodies just has me rapping his verses out loud anyways. Any takers? Don’t take this thread *too* seriously lol",1641055084.0,1497,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rtmw1r/whos_your_favorite_rapper_that_isnt_considered/

Who do you REALLY believe is going to take off in 2022 and become a household name? I've got my money on Baby Keem. He's already huge, but I think in 2022 he's got a chance to become a superstar, A-list rapper.   


My wildcard pick would be Grip from Atlanta. He doesn't really have the current, cool sound that a lot of popular rappers have, but that's what makes him stand out to me. He's so talented as a lyricist and storyteller, and now that he's signed with Shady Records he has some actually resources behind him. I know people say Shady doesn't have the best track record with rising artists, but hopefully Grip's the one.

**Background** by /u/farm_sauce

Through a prophetic sense for the future of the genre, mixed with his undeniable roots in the evolution of popularized hip hop sound, DJ Muggs has become the “Nick Fury” of east coast rap’s Avengers, assembling the most lyrically talented verbal superheroes the east coast has to offer, and has asserted himself as an undeniable force for all that is pure and essential to hip hop.

DJ Muggs, born Lawrence Muggerud, is a Queens borough native with a passion for New York hip hop culture. Muggs started his career DJing in the New York underground scene in 1988, shortly before linking with B-Real and Sen Dog to form one of hip hop’s most iconic supergroups, Cypress Hill. You may have heard of them. Muggs produced 7 albums with the group, four of which achieved platinum status, the remaining three going gold. In the late 80’s and 90’s, Muggs wasn’t just on fire, he was a nuclear fission plant for creating iconic music. Some of his most iconic collaborations were with rap hall-of-famers like GZA, House of Pain, Fundoobiest, and Planet Asia to name a few. He was shaping what the everyday listener thought hip hop could sound like, establishing the genre has an American staple, and creating a sound that would be revisited for decades to come.

It was Muggs who took The Alchemist under his wing in the early 90’s. The Alchemist, who needs no introduction to this sub, sparked Muggs’ growing passion for mentoring and collaborating with new artists, especially those whose musical abilities far surpass their exposure and fame. Muggs wanted to work on the razor’s edge of hip hop, carving a path forward with two things in mind: an undying loyalty to the nostalgic sound of 90’s boom bap production, and absolutely filthy elite lyricism.

In 1997, Muggs released an album titled *Soul Assassins*, defined by its grim and sinister melodies laid under slow-paced and menacing drums, interjected with haunting audio clips that gave the audience an all-too-close look at the rotten underbelly of American society (I strongly recommend this album). It was the first in a series of stylistic releases the production for which would become unique to Muggs and his collaborators. Little did Muggs know that the sound he had coined with his *Soul Assassins* production would eventually open the door for his career revival 20 years later thanks to a string of releases with talented lyricists like Mayhem Lauren, Roc Marciano, Eto, Mach-Hommy, and more.

Enter: Rome Streetz, an aptly named Queens borough native with a passion for word craft. Streetz, or Jerome Allen, grew up fast the same as any kid from Queens, where rapping had become more of an expectation than a possible career choice. His childhood saturated with street violence and the allure of crime and drugs, Rome quickly faced situations that taught him the importance of loyalty, focus, and hustle. Seeing the dark path her son was heading down, Streetz’ own mother decided it best to send him across the Atlantic Ocean to attend high school in a less-dangerous environment: London, England.

It was there at the lunch tables over acapella beat-boxing and fish &amp; chips where Rome discovered his voice and talent for rapping, outpacing his British classmates by a mile (kilometer?) with his intricate New York flows reminiscent of Nas and Mobb Deep. Grime music, though only just beginning to emerge from the London underground, showed Rome how pacing and delivery could affect the impact of his words. Rome Streetz took notes, and after graduating he returned home to New York to hone his craft.

Rome started to upload his mixtapes to DatPiff back in 2011, and in 2016 released his first full-length project *I Been Thru Mad Sh\*t* to generally positive reviews. In 2018, however, he released *Streetz Keep Calling Me*, where Rome separated himself from the pack of rabid New York rappers chomping at the bit for a shot at fortune and fame. He went on to release several more projects from 2018 – 2020, including his highly praised *Noise Kandy* mixtape series, which features four installments full to the fitted-cap brim of pure and crystalline bars. He has most recently been moving around with Griselda headman Westside Gunn, who touts him as the next big rapper out of NYC.

Rome and Muggs first linked up at an event in Brooklyn, where Muggs recognized the evident talent contributing to Rome’s growing success and praised him for it. After DM’ing back and forth for a while, the two finally reunited at the Soul Assassins studio in LA. After releasing a slew of projects in 2020 and 2021, both Muggs and Rome were each riding their own creative hot streaks unparalleled by 99% of the industry. Both sharing an affinity for the dark and mysterious themes coursing through the veins of the American underground, Rome and Muggs’ wavelengths synced to create one of the boldest, most interesting, and technically impressive hip hop albums this year: *Death &amp; The Magician*.

**Review** by /u/farm_sauce

There aren’t many albums that stick with you the way *Death &amp; The Magician* has stuck with me. DATM was my first taste of what both Rome Streetz and DJ Muggs were capable of, and after the rise of Griselda in 2019 and 2020 which has constituted a great awakening to the rebirth of 90’s New York hip hop, I’ve completely shifted my musical preferences as a result. Never before have I heard such a pure and direct assault on my senses. Never before have I been so helplessly and happily lost in an artist’s lyrics, or experienced the involuntary nodding of my head and curling of my upper lip in response to a beat alone. To quote the first comment I read on YouTube after listening to DATM, Rome Streetz and DJ Muggs created a classic with this one.

At 13 songs, and a total runtime of just under 34 minutes, DATM is a perfectly paced project. There are no songs that are too long or too short, yet they each undoubtedly leave you wanting more. Synonymous with Death, the number 13 is significant, too, as DATM is not just a stellar hip hop album, but a multi-faceted concept album rife with themes of the occult both dark and light. The album exists primarily as an outlet for Rome Streetz to unleash his pen to educate all of his fans and haters alike of the trials and tribulations of thriving in the streets. DJ Muggs supplies the pedestal from which Rome delivers his ghetto street gospels, integrating his grim and high-octane production with Rome’s deadly and twisting rhyme schemes. With DATM, the duo created a sound somewhere between an organized crime TED talk and a cemetery freestyle session, dark and determined in all its glory.

The album’s concept is seated squarely in the world of the occult, specifically divination, and the tarot cards used to divine fortunes back in the 18th century. Death, for example, is the 13th card in most traditional tarot decks, and while it can be interpreted as actual death in divination, it is most typically associated with rebirth, light, and eternity. On the other hand, the Magician is the first card, and by all accounts refers to a person who is using all of the tools at their disposal to their benefit—the magician is a master of the elements. The big question is, of DJ Muggs and Rome Streetz, who plays the role of Death and who plays the Magician?

In classic DJ Muggs style, “6 Of Cups” starts the album with Muggs and Rome Streetz delivering a status update on the state of the streets over a backdrop of somber violins. Audio clips of newscasters reporting various gun crimes give the track a very real emotional connection to Rome’s words. The 6 of Cups in tarot divination refers to your past, specifically your past coming back into your life. It’s here that we immediately are exposed to some themes that will remain prevalent throughout the album: trust, loyalty, and betrayal. We hear Rome and Muggs trade commentary on how dangerous it is to be outside these days. “Sh\*ts different, like… n\*ggas walk around with f\*ckin’ masks on all day, you don’t event know if that’s your… friend or your enemy.” Rome says one line about survival as the violins swell that particularly sticks out: “It’s either me or you nowadays, and I been through too much f\*ckin’ sh\*t for it to be me.” He then speaks the most prophetic words of the album, “you gotta stay crazy… n\*ggas be saying ‘stay dangerous’… \[because\] that ‘be safe’ sh\*t will still get your muh’ f\*ckin’ sh\*t clapped”. For a first track, “6 Of Cups” does a great job at reeling the listener in close and emotionally investing them in the story to come.

The albums first song “Prayers Over Packages” features a recollection of Rome Streetz’ come up laid down over a slow and drawn-out Muggs beat. Streetz asks “What gets you killed faster: too much love, trust, or truth?” implying early on that he’s been burned by those he has loved in the past. Rome sings the hook, “I said prayers over packages, hopin’ to God that I can sell em’ fast as sh\*t/ Mommy told me ""never slack off, n\*gga there's plenty cash to get”/ Never get too caught up in the moment, gotta capture it"", where he’s speaking on his lack of time to become successful. We hear about friends who have perished, or gone to jail, leaving Rome behind to either meltdown or continue grinding on his way to accomplish his goals. Rome repeatedly chooses to chase his dream over letting his circumstance drag him down, and he is aware enough to recognize that he isn’t just surviving, but thriving. He isn’t just some “rappity-rap” artist, but more so an entire complex personality with more life experience than most at the age of 34.

“Ace Of Swords” is by far my favorite track on the entire album. First off, the beat by DJ Muggs is just unparalleled. A mix between the grimy sewers under a city and the climax of a horror flick, Muggs is essentially kickstarting the album with this track by giving Rome a seriously dope beat to explode on—and Rome delivers. On this track we get to witness just how good the chemistry is between these two, as well as Rome’s impressive vocabulary. Rome spits devious lyrics about his plans for his career, rapping “Put me in a group with you n\*ggas, bet I come out with a shearling coat/ All you n\*ggas sleep sheep, my aim’s to flood the world with smoke”. Basically, Rome is saying that no matter how many opponents he’s faced with he will always come out on top, and he won’t be stopping there. In divination, the Ace of Swords refers to someone who has acquired new knowledge. Rome interprets this as lessons learned from fake friends, and praises those who were true hustlers, rapping “I wish Big was able to slide in that truck/ And Pac clapped the n\*ggas in that Caddie that was ridin' up/ Sh\*t’d be different, still I carry tradition”. The hook is one of the most impressive on the album in my opinion, with Rome basically laying out a creed for a successful life.

Building off his creed for success, on “The Manuscript” Rome elaborates even further about how you have to act to achieve success. “I hustle, ain't nothing coming free/ I don't even wanna talk if you n\*ggas ain't bringing dollars my way/ I go and get it now, so why the f\*ck should I wait?/ My mind is focused on this money I make”. Rome basically tells us here that you’ll learn more about hustling from wheeling and dealing in the street than you ever could in school. When you learn to hustle, success becomes inevitable—it’s just about how many hours you put in at that point. However, Rome also recognizes that this life style is not without its drawbacks, and in fact many people have died in pursuit of their own dreams. Regardless, Rome feels confident in his path, and after coming such a long way he is still determined to continue to grow.

On “High Explosive”, DJ Muggs sets an anxiety-fueled charge of police brutality and increasing murder rates across America as Rome Streetz lights the fuse for an imminent detonation. Something in America is burning, and Rome can smell the smoke. Here we get some cleverly crafted bars about injustice and police brutality, with Rome offering an escape to anyone who needs one—his music. “Rap and trap, move the music like a bag of coke/ Fiend the world the f\*ck out for the cash we gross”. However dark Rome’s intentions may sound, he’s emphasizing that people can get hooked on his music and find light to remain optimistic that one day things will be okay.

“Zig Zag Zig”, named after the RZA, features Rome showcasing some straightforward storytelling over exasperated Muggs production. In similar fashion to the Wu-Tang legend in question, Rome gives us yet another flawless verse detailing his career before music and how his struggle is representative of the experience of most black children. Here we get to witness that when Rome isn’t knotting his verses together with intricate wordplay, he’s an accomplished storyteller who can evoke vivid imagery. We also get a guest verse by Knowledge The Pirate, who delivers some grizzled heavy-hitting bars about dealing drugs and a life of crime. Knowledge raps, “One love to all my lifers and my n\*ggas locked on Rikers/ And f\*ck them 85ers, they don't ABC or like us”, reminding us that his lifestyle wasn’t a choice but a necessity to survive, and that most people in America still don’t understand that.

The track “Stone Cold Soul” continues to build off of the theme’s established by earlier tracks, especially the come up and a distaste for authority. Over a beat fit for Gotham City henchmen, Rome raps, “Prescribe the homicide, now I’m coming to clap sh\*t”, explaining that growing up as he did, murder was his fate prescribed by society, and instead of taking that literally he decided to instead commit verbal homicide. He goes so far as to say “F\*ck throwing n\*ggas off of the roof now, I'd rather make 'em jump”. Rome is literally so skilled at wordplay that he’s going to convince his enemies to kill themselves (or at least quit).

“The Devil’s Chord”, named for the “flatted fifth note” which is an infamous note used in blues and rock music which distinctively sticks out from the rest of the notes played, features themes of systematic oppression, societal depression, and taking advantage. Rome thinks of himself as a “Devil’s Chord” of sorts, as he has separated from the pack and made a lane for himself. The rest of this track is Rome relentlessly berating the sorry state of the post-COVID country as he raps, “Covid, is it real or is it fake? They tryna kill us all/ Politicians got a trick system, the sh\*t is wicked, dog/ N\*ggas in the can going nuts, they cut they visits off/ Stressed out, even the kindergarten teachers sniffin' soft”. Rome synonymizes the pandemic with the state of the streets, describing piles of unidentified bodies, all wearing masks, the pain evident behind their eyes. Rome again reminds us to take care of ourselves when it’s all said and done.

DJ Muggs changes the pace on “Shooting At The Dance Hall” by giving Rome a fast-paced, blown-out speaker beat fit for a Jamaican dance hall. Here we get some reiterated points about Rome’s come up, fake friends, and leading the way to greatness. This song is really just fun as hell and a nice change of pace from the rest of the album. You don’t need to listen to every word to understand the themes put across by Streetz, and you can still bob your head and shake your shoulders to Muggs production. A good example of DJ Muggs’ ability to keep the crowd alive.

On “Wheel Of Fortune” we get an excellent “Tony Story” style song by Rome about the rise and fall of one of his supposed friends from back home. The story itself is about someone taking the life of crime—the same life that Rome was living before he shifted to music. Rome tells us that this person was successful in the streets by saying “Long story short, sh\*t transformed, now it's awesomе/ He up flossin', made a pie out a portion” right before he reminds us that “Now sun shine in the ghetto, 'fore the star of death get closer when you rise up a level”. The Wheel of Fortune in divination represents completion, good luck, and divine blessings. Rome reminds us with this song that luck runs out, and those around us are all too happy to watch it happen.

“Horn &amp; Halo” gives us a slow-motion western-style beat by Muggs with verses from Rome and Rigz. Rome Streetz once again describes the dichotomy of his life, “I been conflicted since birth, born with a horn and halo”. Even though Rome chose rapping, he can still feel the black cloud of crime and violence following him around, and he channels it coolly through his music. The guest verse by Rigz is full of choppy bars a-la Earl Sweatshirt, and stays in line with most of Rome’s messages about focus and betrayal on DATM.

“Fly Obnoxious” is a close second for my favorite track on the album. The raw energy that Rome brings to DJ Muggs perilous-sounding and anxiety-ridden beat makes for an absolute adrenaline filled performance. In line with the title of the song, Rome uses this track to flex anything left on the table. His lyrics here are so elite that they catch the listener in a trance listening to peak Rome Streetz brag about how helpless the game is with him at the helm. We get the impression here that Rome can only repeat himself so many times before his doubters learn their lesson, and this track very much feels like a crack in Rome’s otherwise calm and composed demeanor. He also delivers my favorite line from the album “Ya flavorless, I blaze whoever's on your favorite list/ I'm made for this, I'm Neo making his way through the matrix”. The delivery of this line is what really set it apart from the rest, and cemented Rome’s mastery over his vocabulary.

The final track, “F\*ck You know About Me” presents a summation of the points Rome has harped on for the previous 12 tracks. DJ Muggs puts together an ironically upbeat sound for this one, sampling what sounds like a game show theme to let Rome say his final words. The main point of this track was to reinforce the narrative of controlling your own narrative. “Everything you do in your life is a chess move,” which Rome hopes will stick with his audience and maybe make someone think a bit more before acting and doing something stupid. DJ Muggs decides to end the album on an audio clip of a couple of young men being interviewed about the return of a notorious criminal to New York. One can’t help but feel as though Rome sees himself in this way returning home to New York after recording DATM in LA. He’s just murdered the competition from a different city, and he hopes when he returns home he will be welcomed with open arms.

The cards themselves chosen to elicit themes on DATM say a lot about the duo’s values as well. We saw the Cups and Swords suits make appearances, which signified value in love, nostalgia, mentality, and knowledge. Notably absent were the Wands and Pentacles suits, which represent values that Rome frequently incorporate into his lyrics—money, worldly possessions, creativity, and passion. Stylistically, Rome has room to grow and experiment with his voice. As a pure lyricist, he is a god-tier contender, and I think he will be an excellent addition to the Griselda collective in years to come.

Overall, the album features the best performances from Rome Streetz and DJ Muggs in recent years. The two build off of each other in a really positive way that creates an ambience about their music which lends depth and consciousness to the final product. The concept of tarot cards and divination turned an otherwise run-of-the-mill technically impressive album into a mysterious and multi-faceted project. A 25-minute film was released to accompany the album, which goes even further to add depth and evoke specific imagery. Muggs and Streetz really went all out for this project, and left no card unturned creatively.

486,ALBUM,"This might be long and a little disorganized, please bear with me.

To start, there is obviously a very distinct and beyond exhausted sonic difference in east coast and west coast rap. Some of that can be lent to the history, culture, socioeconomic factors, and geographic features of each coast. There are obviously motifs and nuances specific to each state and sometimes even city or neighborhood because of all these reasons and so much more. I think the stylistic differences we’ve witnessed being created, cemented, and blurred between coasts has been a fantastic way to document the ways hip hop and humanity has evolved. Aside from that, what I want to talk about is what associations do you have with west coast and/or east coast hip hop? What colors, memories, theories, smells, images, stories, etc etc come to mind for you and why? What artist embodies each respective coast/a particular city and why? How has the coast/city’s current sound reflected modern times in comparison to the music that came before? How would the music differ if were to change things as simple as the weather or something more nuanced like access to education or being of a higher or lower income? Do you think that the sounds we associate with each coast on a grand scale would be the same if anything were changed, why or why not? How do the lyrics and music reflect and furthermore influence the culture and communities of artists on both a international and state/city/neighborhood scale? By tweaking some of these factors, would the trajectory of the genre have changed? You get where I’m going. I wanted to know what everyone else thought about this or could add anything…

Sampling is an instrument and a tradition that we’ve seen refined, confused, reduced, celebrated, and fully integrated into contemporary music. Sampling is a very touching way to pay tribute the past while expanding upon, warping, considering, and creating something new/different/better. Sampling honors history for all it is and brings a song along for another wave of listening, appreciating, and understanding for a new generation to hear. Through sampling, we can connect to the past and bring forgotten artists to life. This being said, what are some of your favorite samples and why? What samples bring you nostalgia and what samples led you to discover new artists? What samples were the most creative? In the history of the genre, what samples have been the most influential and why? How has sampling changed the course of the genre? You get where I’m getting at.",1640997707.0,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rt7gzg/howwhy_does_geographic_location_contribute_to_the/

563,ALBUM,"[DISCUSSION] Wu-Tang Clan – Wu-Tang Iron Flag (20 Years Later)

For a group that had found a signature sound on its debut that sounded like nothing else at the time, it's weird Wu-Tang Clan’s other albums do everything but return to that sound. Their subsequent albums visited string elements (Wu-Tang Forever), blaxploitation/soul atmospheres (The W) and then, 20 Years ago as of December, 18th, some sprinkles old-school hip hop. The shortest Wu-Tang album, Iron Flag tries new ideas on almost every track. Da Glock got is an example for an interesting idea, but skippable on 3rd, 4th and later listens. Chrome Wheels has a big bassline, but a weird chorus which makes for an unique charm.

Rules, Iron Flag and Radioactive (Four Assassins) are the kind of songs where its less experimental, but [Uzi (Pinky Ring)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rR8fKgRJ0M) shows that the sound can be great if everything finally clicks together.",1640889910.0,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rs8wrt/discussion_wutang_clan_wutang_iron_flag_20_years/

601,ALBUM,"Nas’ eighth studio album continues the run of good albums of Stillmatic and God’s Son. 

Its sometimes ridiculed because of its title, often cited to make fun of old head mentality. Indeed, listening to the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAKxjTRV6ms), nestled between [Carry On Tradition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwqR8QkyKGU), [Where Are They Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCzuTvVcjo) and [Who Killed It?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmYaJxFOvng) it is clear that he critizises the status quo. 

However, in the later acapella track [Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIYbfTBa5A) he says

> Because if you asking: ""Why is Hip Hop dead?""

> It's a pretty good chance, you the reason it died, man

> It's a pretty good, chance your lame ass, corny ass

> Is the reason it died, man

which somehow puts an end to the discussion and is also a sign that everything that needed to be said about the topic has been said in the last 60 minutes. These didn't only contain lamenting rhetoric but also a few examples of how it could be done better.

The cold storytelling of [Blunt Ashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWyeC_J3Wx4) and [Hold Down The Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF8i4ch5FxI) is prime Nas material. The album also provides some hard boom bap beats in [Money Over Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZr_7DJSP5M) and the feud-ending [Black Republican]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZr_7DJSP5M) with Jay-Z.",1640804501.0,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/rrfqov/discussion_nas_hip_hop_is_dead_15_years_later/

605,ALBUM,"My Turn is the second studio album by American rapper Lil Baby. It was released on February 28, 2020, by Capitol Records, Motown Records, Wolfpack Music Group, and Quality Control Music.

The latter song received two Grammy nominations at the 2021 Grammy Awards.

>**Is Lil Baby 2020's MVP?**  
I see a lot of people saying 2020's rap MVP is Lil Baby. He had the song of the summer with We Paid (Feat. 42 Dugg), dropped a somewhat concious rap song and it hit #2 on the Hot 100, and went 2x platinum. Commerically, he's there. Quality wise, he's not close. My Turn is quite overrated in my opinion. The production is literally youtube-beat quality outside of Forever (Feat. Lil Wayne). More often than not, Baby's performance is average. He fails on songs where the beats are particularly bad and rarely makes a beat better besides Forever (Feat. Lil Wayne) and We Paid (Feat. 42 Dugg). The features range from bad to solid. My Turn isn't a bad album but it certainly doesn't deserve the praise it gets.
