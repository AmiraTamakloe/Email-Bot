# Reddit-Music-Bot

This project in collaboration with my friends Jacob Ducas, Michael Banna and Nour Zahreddine is an application that allows users of the subreddit HipHopHead to create a playlist with all the song names mentioned in the subreddit HipHopHeads. This project purposed was to experiment with API, Bot and Jupyter notebook. This project was done using documentation, public chat, articles and tutorials for the Spotify API. The first document is the one name Berto. this document role is to find the song and album mentioned in the subreddit and put it in a csv document. 
this website helped us access the reddit bot: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-comprehensive-guide-to-creating-a-basic-reddit-bot-part-1-15fb0e4cebcb 

The second document named Spoto’s role was to access Spotify’s API and create the playlist as well as updating it with the songs mentioned on the subreddit. While creating it, we had the idea of letting users add and creating playlist on their own.
